Here we keep all the slides, code and discussions that are related to the [C++ for Yourself](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwhKb0RIaIS1sJkejUmWj-0lk7v_xgCuT) course on YouTube ðŸ“º

## `0` Access the [slides and homeworks](https://github.com/cpp-for-yourself/lectures-and-homeworks)
All of the video content is duplicated as markdown documents in the [lectures-and-homeworks](https://github.com/cpp-for-yourself/lectures-and-homeworks) repository. See its readme to access copyable code and most of the transctiotions of the videos.

To ensure this is a hands-on experience, there are also **homeworks** stored in the same repository. They are mixed in with the slides in the order in which they are expected to be implemented.

## `1` Create your own homework repo from the [homeworks template repo](https://github.com/cpp-for-yourself/homeworks)
I strongly believe that to learn one needs to get their hands dirty. Each homework announced in the videos can be found in [lectures-and-homeworks](https://github.com/cpp-for-yourself/lectures-and-homeworks) repository. Should any instuctions be unclear, please do not hesitate to ask questions under the appropriate videos or in the discussions within this organization.

To submit the homeworks, one can use a template in the the [homeworks](https://github.com/cpp-for-yourself/homeworks) repository by clicking the  <kbd>Use this template</kbd> button. The precise instructions are in the readme of that project.

I'm using a custom python homework checker script (also found in this organization) combined with GitHub actions to check the homeworks.

## `2` Engage in [discussions](https://github.com/orgs/cpp-for-yourself/discussions)!

As this channel takes off please interact with the community!
- If you have any questions or comments about a video - comment under the video
- Should it grow into a deeper discussion, please head to the [discussions](https://github.com/orgs/cpp-for-yourself/discussions) of this org and either comment in an existing topic or start a new one

## `3` Spread the word and support this work
Creating such a course from scratch is quite hard (harder than I planned, as always). Even considering that I'm building on top of the course I designed some time ago, it still takes most of my evenings and weekends to deliver new content. Not everybody has an opportunity to support such undertakings, but if you are in the position where you _can_, please show your appreciation:
- Subscribe to the YouYube channel: [@CodeForYourself](https://www.youtube.com/c/Codeforyourself)
- Support this work through [GitHub sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/niosus)
- Making a one-off donation through [Paypal][donate-paypal]

ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¦ Note that at least until the russian war against Ukraine is over, all your donations will be used to support Ukraine protecting itself from the russian aggression.
