In this organization I'm going to keep all the slides, code and discussions that are related to the [C++ for Yourself](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwhKb0RIaIS1sJkejUmWj-0lk7v_xgCuT) course on YouTube ðŸ“º

## `0` Access the [slides and homeworks](https://github.com/cpp-for-yourself/supplementary-materials)
During the videos I use slides to guide me through whatever I want to say. All of the data for the **slides** is generated via [Marp for VSCode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=marp-team.marp-vscode) from the markdown files stored in the [supplementary-materials](https://github.com/cpp-for-yourself/supplementary-materials) repository. So if you'd like to have copyable code and whatnot, you can find everything there.

You will also find the tasks that you would then do as your **homeworks** there. They are mixed in with the slides in the order in which they have to be done.


## `1` Create your own homework repo from the [homeworks template repo](https://github.com/cpp-for-yourself/homeworks)
If you want to maximize your learnings from this course, you should do the homeworks. I will announce each homework in the videos of the course and you can find the precise tasks in the [supplementary-materials](https://github.com/cpp-for-yourself/supplementary-materials) repository.

To submit the homeworks, you'll have to use the template in the the [homeworks](https://github.com/cpp-for-yourself/homeworks) repository by clicking the  <kbd>Use this template</kbd> button. The precise instructions are in the readme of that project.

I'm using a custom python homework checker (also found in this organization) combined with GitHub actions to check the homeworks.

## `2` Engage in [discussions](https://github.com/orgs/cpp-for-yourself/discussions)!

As this channel takes off please interact with the community!
- If you have a simple question about a video - comment under the video
- If you want a deeper discussion, then head to the [discussions](https://github.com/orgs/cpp-for-yourself/discussions) of this org and either comment in an existing topic or start a new one

## `3` Spread the word and support this work
Creating such a course from scratch is an enourmous undertaking. Even considering that I'm building on top of the course I designed some time ago, it still takes most of my evenings and weekends to deliver new content. Please consider also that you're getting this for free. Not everybody has an opportunity to support such undertakings, but if you are in the position where you can, you can show your appreciation by:
- Supporting me through [GitHub sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/niosus)
- Supporting me through [Patreon](https://patreon.com/code_for_yourself?utm_medium=clipboard_copy&utm_source=copyLink&utm_campaign=creatorshare_creator)
- Making a one-off donation through [Paypal][donate-paypal]

ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¦ Note that at least until the russian war against Ukraine is over, all your donations will be used to support Ukraine protecting itself from the russian aggression.
